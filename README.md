# QAChatbot_Ollama

This code creates a Q&A chatbot using Ollama's open-source language models (e.g., Gemma:2b, Mistral) for natural language processing. It leverages LangChain's structured prompting and Streamlit's web framework to offer a dynamic interface. Users can customize parameters like the model, temperature, and token limit, enabling fine-tuned responses. The project integrates LangSmith for tracking and debugging, providing a versatile tool for interactive AI-driven queries.
